#### A simple WPF calculator styled off the the work from [Faustine](https://dribbble.com/garnouche)

This calculator was styled using this [Dribbble Post](https://dribbble.com/shots/6556922--Calculator), here is a little image 
of her **amazing work** for reference:

Here is the form that I created, I hope you agree with me that it sticks pretty truthfully to the reference image :relaxed:
I have also left the exe in the GitHub files incase you want to download it and have a play ðŸ–©

Let me know what you think ðŸŽ‰ There were a lot of bugs with the original code-behind so I completely changed it to what I think a calculator should do. There are still a couple of bugs/missing features that I might add in future.

~I know there are still quite a lot bugs, but it's fun just to create a functional thingy from the sketch up~
